# Transportation-In-

Hi Humans!

Students and adults who use public transportation on a daily bases need an efficient way to recharge their tap cards, pay their bus fee, as well as knowing at what time their bus is coming. 

My partner Bryan and I have been trying to figure out a way to combine a GPS and a paying system in a mobile application, therefor its going to be similar to "Transit App", "Google Maps", "Pay Pal", and "Apple Pay" where we use NFC to send the desired amount of money to the bus or even; a transfer of money to a person's bank account.
